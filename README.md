# 🐧 Linux Automation Scripts with Bash (Ubuntu + Nginx + GitHub)

A hands-on scripting project aimed at automating core DevOps tasks in a Linux environment using Bash. This project demonstrates practical automation of system monitoring, GitHub repo management, and Nginx-based web hosting, all tested and executed in a real Ubuntu terminal environment.

## 📚 Overview

This project is a collection of Bash scripts designed to streamline routine system administration and DevOps workflows. Whether you're spinning up a web server, monitoring system health, or pushing code to GitHub, these scripts reduce manual overhead and promote consistency.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **System Health Checker**  
  Monitors CPU usage, memory consumption, and available disk space in real-time and outputs warnings based on thresholds.

- ✅ **GitHub Workflow Automation**  
  Automatically initializes a Git repository, adds a remote origin, stages files, commits, and pushes to GitHub — all through a single script.

- ✅ **Nginx Web Server Setup**  
  Automates the full setup of a static website on Ubuntu using Nginx. Installs Nginx, configures the default server block, copies website files, and restarts the service.
