➤ -n 1: Number of iterations
This tells top how many times it should run before quitting.

-n 1 means: "Run just once, then exit."-b: Batch mode
Normally, top runs interactively (keeps updating the screen).

With -b (batch mode), it runs just once and prints the output to the terminal.

Useful for scripts, because you don’t want it to keep updating.
